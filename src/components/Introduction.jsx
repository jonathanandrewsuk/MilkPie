        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>
          Jonny likes to read books written by a handful of authors.
          <ul>
            <li>Problem is that he cannot find stores that sell a book (any book) from his favorite authors and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> So we create a portal for Jonny to easily contact stores that can help him find a good book to read that does not cost much money</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
